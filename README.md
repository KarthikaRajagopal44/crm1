1. url routing in django and views work together to return templates to a user
2. we gonna add some html templates to the project and rendered them out in our views instead of these httpresponse. Also the concept of template inheritance so we can reuse sections of code like a navigation bar so we are not having to build this out in each template we can just simply input that into our main template  and resuse it.
